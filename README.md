# ArduinoThermoControlWeb

A flask server that should simplify the logging of our temp control. The website assumes that the Arduinos are connected via a serial device. For the moment we have to following abilities:

- Add a few arduinos.
- Give setpoint and live temperature in overview.
- It shows data in a long list for the moment.
- It is possible to save the values to an hdf5 file.
- The setpoint can be changed in the config page.
- The data can be exported to csv.
- PID values can be set from the interface.


On the technical side we use the following ingredients:
- Communication with the Arduino is done through the Serial interface. We will look into the ethernet interface at some point.
- Updates on the client are done through flask_socketio.
- The layout is made nice through flask_bootstrap.
- Graphics are done with plotly.js

The project should serve as a boilerplate for our other sensors too.

Further, we will most likely not install saving of the data on the server as this would make the whole thing MUCH more complicated (where and who to store the data. Which data should we show etc.)

# Installation

- download github for desktop
- set up the proxy for github
- get mini-conda
- open the anaconda prompt
- set the proxy for anaconda
- create a new directory
- clone the repository through in the new folder through
 > git clone ...
- create a new virtualenv through
 > conda create -n YOURNAME python=3.6
- activate the virtualenv through
> source activate YOURNAME
- install the dependencies through
> pip install -r requirements.txt

 or if you are at the kip:

 > pip --proxy http://proxy.kip.uni-heidelberg.de:8080 install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt
- set up the database through

> flask db upgrade

- start flask through

> start.sh
- open it in a brower on 'localhost:5000'

# Usage
## The server itself
 - activate the virtualenv through 'source activate YOURNAME'
 - start it through 'start.sh'
 - runs on 'localhost:5000'

## Test without Arduino

 If you want to test the serial port without having an Arduino, you should just
 start another terminal, and run the _simSerialPort.py_ file through 'python simSerialPort.py'

## Saving to hdf5

We can save the last data to an hdf5 It  is assumed that the file is already created. Most likely from some program from the  [labscriptsuite](www.labscript.org) or our _NaLi_ control system. An example for calling it from matlab is found in _matlabPythonComm.m_ .

To save a temp control current file you can call file by calling the _'save_tc/TCNR+FNAME'_. TCNR is the number of the controller that you want to read out. FNAME is the file name.

## Dev updates to the database

If you are changing the properties of the models.py files, it is likely, that you are messing the the tables of the sqlite file in the background of the script. To keep it simple we are using [flask-migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to keep track. You then have to create the update command through:

> flask db migrate

It creates a new python file in the migrations folder. You then update the sqlite database through a:

> flask db upgrade

# TODO

 [x] Allow for changing the parameters of the feedback loop through some serial communication.

 [x] Allow for a cleaner communication between the arduino and flask. Basically, the arduino should only answer to a question be flask.

 [] Allow to change the different axis by hand in the plotly stuff.

 [] Move the information about communications and users into a local database. I think that would make it much more robust.

 [] Tidy up the connections and also the code in the back-end.

 [] Always make it look cuter.

 [] Error logger to communicate with slack or via email.

 [] make this readme the about page.


# Database migration

To  update run
> flask db migrate

> flask db upgrade
